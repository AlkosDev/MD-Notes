# MD Notes

MD Notes is a web application made using ReactJS.
It's purpose is to give an user easy ability to edit, create, download and preview markdown files.
Every note is saved in the Localstorage.
MD Notes idea was inspired by freeCodeCamp.org [ReactJS tutorial on YouTube](https://youtu.be/bMknfKXIFA8?list=PLeYcUSvfaLbsFkmUZQvbgUO1RplZ0Zx9f&t=36647).
The editor was slightly improved compared to its counterpart from the video.
Website design goes to [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).
Code is entirely mine excluding the ReactJS itself.
icons and favicon are made by [fontawesome.com](https://fontawesome.com/icons).
Font provided by [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
